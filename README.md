# Twitter backend application

This reposiotory contains my project in which I implemented simple backend that can be used for applications like Twitter. It mainly helped me to develop my skills and gain knowledge about Java, Spring Boot and other related APIs that are required to become a Java developer.

### Used technologies
- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3.0+ including:
  - Spring Web
  - Spring Data JPA
  - Spring Security
- MySQL 8.0+
- Lombok
- JUnit5
- Mockito

### Main functionalities
- handling CRUD operations using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, DELETE
- validating and persisting data
- securing endpoints and generating JWT tokens to ensure that only authenticated users can see the contents
- password encrypting to keep users' passwords secret
